<br>

<p>This website has a password generator. The coding language used to create a functional password generator is Javascript. In this day and age, a lot of websites store data on behalf of the consumers and in turn it is the duty of the website owners to ensure that the website is secure. A password generator ensures that a complex password is generated, the generator gives the user the opportunity to select the complexity of the password. The generator gives the user the option to select special characters, numbers, lower and upper case characters, which then produces a password with the character length restricted to what the user set as the limit. When making the password generator I had to implement a basic understanding of javascript including using variables, constants, if & else statements, prompt & confirm windows and using a 'for' loop <p>
